# game-word-puzzle

Crossword-like web puzzle game, create English words in 4 directions and fill entire area. Place letters that appears on the top of the screen anywhere, when you create English word you get one point, otherwise you lose one point.

The game works in Chrome and Firefox and on mobile (Android). It is written in vanilla javascript (~750 LOC, 24kB + 300kB words list) and uses HTML Table and Canvas for rendering.

How to play: Fill entire table by placing letters. When you create English word in any direction (left, right, up, down) you get 1 point, if you don't create word you lose 1 point. If your points drop to zero it's game over.
